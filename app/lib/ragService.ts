## My Work Philosophy & Approach

### Development Philosophy
I believe in building things that actually matter, yaar! Not just coding for the sake of coding, but creating solutions that solve real problems. I'm all about:

- **User-first approach:** If users don't get it, we've failed
- **Clean, readable code:** Future me should thank present me
- **Learning by building:** Best way to understand something is to build it from scratch
- **Collaboration over competition:** We rise by lifting others

### Problem-Solving Approach
When I hit a problem, I don't panic (well, maybe a little üòÖ). My process:
1. **Break it down:** Complex problems are just many small problems in disguise
2. **Research first:** Someone smarter has probably faced this before
3. **Prototype quickly:** Get something working, then make it better
4. **Ask for help:** No shame in seeking guidance from seniors or community

### Learning Philosophy
I'm a firm believer in "learn by doing." You can read 100 tutorials, but until you build something and break it 10 times, you haven't really learned it. That's why I'm always building side projects!

### Work Style
- **Morning person:** My brain works best 6-10 AM
- **Deep work blocks:** I prefer 2-3 hour focused sessions over scattered work
- **Documentation:** If I didn't document it, it didn't happen
- **Testing:** Bugs in production are like typos in love letters - embarrassing! üòÇ
    `

    // Educational Background

## Educational Background & Journey

### Current Education
- **BTech Computer Science Engineering** at Manipal University Jaipur (2023-2027)
- **Current Year:** 2nd year (Class of 2027)
- **CGPA:** Maintaining 8.5+ (because grades do matter, despite what they say! üòÑ)

### Academic Focus Areas
- **Core CS:** Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS, Operating Systems
- **Specialization:** AI/ML, Full-Stack Development, Cloud Computing
- **Favorite Subjects:** Machine Learning, Web Technologies, Database Systems
- **Least Favorite:** Physics (sorry, Newton! üôà)

### Learning Journey
Started coding in 12th grade with Python because a senior told me "Python is easy." Spoiler alert: nothing in programming is truly easy, but Python is definitely friendlier!

**Timeline:**
- **2022:** Started with Python basics and web scraping
- **2023:** Discovered web development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **2023-24:** Fell in love with React and Node.js
- **2024:** Got into AI/ML and never looked back
- **2025:** Currently exploring Web3 and blockchain

### Self-Learning Philosophy
University teaches you to think, but the internet teaches you to build. I spend equal time on both!

**My Learning Stack:**
- **YouTube:** For quick tutorials and concepts
- **Documentation:** When I need to go deep
- **GitHub:** Learning from other people's code
- **Building Projects:** The ultimate teacher
